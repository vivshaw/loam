# Implementing a Project

Execute plan phase-by-phase, loading each phase just-in-time to minimize context usage.

**Core principle:** read one phase → execute all tasks → review → move to next phase. Loading all phases upfront burns the context you need for the work.

Use `core:critique-reviewing-code` for the review loop (dispatch, fix, re-review until zero issues).

## Overview

**When NOT to use:**
- No project plan exists yet (use `core:project-writing-plan` first)
- Plan needs revision (brainstorm first)

## Reporting on Subagents

**Before dispatching any subagent:**
- Briefly explain (2-3 sentences) what you're asking the agent to do
- State which phase this covers

**After a subagent completes**, report in a sentence or two: what it did, and whether it succeeded. Surface anything that changes what happens next — failing tests, unresolved review issues, work it skipped or couldn't do.

## Project Plan Path

If the user hasn't provided a path to a project plan directory, ask for it rather than guessing.

Use AskUserQuestion:
```
Question: "Which project plan should I execute?"
Options:
  - [list any plan directories you find in .loam/tasks/]
  - "Let me provide the path"
```

If `.loam/tasks/` doesn't exist or is empty, ask the user to provide the path directly.

Executing the wrong plan is expensive to unwind, so let the user name it explicitly.

## The Process

### 1. Discover Phases

Don't read the full phase files yet. List them and read only the header and task markers.

```bash
# List phase files
ls [plan-directory]/phase_*.md

# For each file, get the header (first 10 lines include title and Goal)
head -10 [plan-directory]/phase_01.md

# Get task/subcomponent structure without reading full content
grep -E "START_TASK_|START_SUBCOMPONENT_" [plan-directory]/phase_01.md

# Get completion state — which tasks are already done
grep -n "^- \[" [plan-directory]/phase_*.md
```

If some checkboxes are already checked, that work is complete. Start with the first unchecked boxes.

The header includes the title (`# [Phase Title]`) and `**Goal:**` line. Extract the title for the task entry.

The grep output shows the task structure, e.g.:
```
<!-- START_TASK_1 -->
<!-- START_TASK_2 -->
<!-- START_SUBCOMPONENT_A (tasks 3-5) -->
<!-- START_TASK_3 -->
<!-- START_TASK_4 -->
<!-- START_TASK_5 -->
```

Examples of headers you might see:
- `# Document Infrastructure Project Plan` — Phase 1 implied
- `# Phase 4: Link Resolution` — Phase number explicit

**Check for implementation guidance:**

After discovering phases, check if `.loam/project-plan-guidance.md` exists in the project root:

```bash
# Check for implementation guidance (note the absolute path for later use)
ls [project-root]/.loam/project-plan-guidance.md
```

If the file exists, note its **absolute path** for use during code reviews. If it doesn't exist, proceed without it—do not pass a nonexistent path to reviewers.

**Check for test requirements:**

Check if `test-requirements.md` exists in the plan directory:

```bash
# Check for test requirements (note the absolute path for later use)
ls [plan-directory]/test-requirements.md
```

If the file exists, note its **absolute path** for use during final review. The test requirements document specifies what automated tests must exist for each acceptance criterion.

**Create a session-isolated scratchpad directory:**

```bash
# Extract slug from plan directory name (last path component, without trailing slash)
SLUG=$(basename "[plan-directory]")
# Generate unique session ID
SESSION_ID=$(printf '%04x%04x' $RANDOM $RANDOM)
# Create scratchpad path
SCRATCHPAD_DIR="/tmp/exec-${SLUG}-${SESSION_ID}"
mkdir -p "${SCRATCHPAD_DIR}"
echo "${SCRATCHPAD_DIR}"
```

This scratchpad ensures isolation when multiple execution sessions run in parallel. Pass it to `core:critic-code-reviewer` invocations.

### 2. Create Phase-Level Task List

Use TaskCreate to create **three task entries per phase** (or TodoWrite in older Claude Code versions). Include the title from the header:

```
- [ ] Phase 1a: Read /absolute/path/to/phase_01.md — Document Infrastructure Project Plan
- [ ] Phase 1b: Execute tasks
- [ ] Phase 1c: Code review
- [ ] Phase 2a: Read /absolute/path/to/phase_02.md — API Integration
- [ ] Phase 2b: Execute tasks
- [ ] Phase 2c: Code review
...
```

**Why absolute paths in task entries:** After compaction, context may be summarized. The absolute path in the task entry ensures you always know exactly which file to read.

**Why include the title:** Gives visibility into what each phase covers without loading full content.

### 3. Execute Each Phase

For each phase, follow this cycle:

#### 3a. Read Phase File (just-in-time)

Mark "Phase Na: Read [path]" as in_progress.

Read only that phase file now. Extract:
- List of tasks in this phase
- Working directory
- Any phase-specific context

Mark "Phase Na: Read" as complete.

#### 3b. Execute All Tasks

Mark "Phase Nb: Execute tasks" as in_progress.

**Before dispatching, verify test coverage for functionality tasks:**

If a functionality task (code that does something) has no tests specified:
1. Check if a subsequent task in the same phase provides tests
2. If no tests exist anywhere for this functionality, that's a plan gap — surface it to the user: "Task N implements [functionality] but no corresponding tests exist in the plan. This needs tests before implementation."

A missing test is a hole in the plan, not a step to skip.

**Execute all tasks in sequence.** For each task, dispatch `core:executor-task` with the phase file path:

```
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">core:executor-task</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Implementing Phase X, Task Y: [description]</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
  Implement Task N from the phase file.

  Phase file: [absolute path to phase file]
  Task number: N

  Read the phase file and implement Task N (look for `<!-- START_TASK_N -->`).

  Your job is to:
  1. Read the phase file to understand context
  2. Apply all relevant skills, such as `style:coding-effectively`
  3. Implement exactly what Task N specifies
  4. Verify with tests/build/lint
  5. Commit your work
  6. Report back with evidence

  Work from: [directory]

  Provide complete report per your agent instructions.
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**For subcomponents** (grouped tasks), dispatch once for all tasks in the subcomponent:

```
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">core:executor-task</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Implementing Phase X, Subcomponent A (Tasks 3-5): [description]</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
  Implement Subcomponent A (Tasks 3, 4, 5) from the phase file.

  Phase file: [absolute path to phase file]
  Tasks: 3, 4, 5 (look for `<!-- START_SUBCOMPONENT_A -->`)

  Read the phase file and implement all tasks in this subcomponent.

  Your job is to:
  1. Read the phase file to understand context
  2. Apply all relevant skills, such as `style:coding-effectively`
  3. Implement all tasks in sequence
  4. Verify with tests/build/lint after completing all tasks
  5. Commit your work (one commit per task, or logical commits)
  6. Report back with evidence for each task

  Work from: [directory]

  Provide complete report covering all tasks.
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**Check each core:executor-task result** before moving to the next task.

**Then tick the task's checkbox in the phase file.** Edit `- [ ] ### Task N: ...` to `- [x] ### Task N: ...`.

The checkbox is the durable record of progress. Your task list is session state and dies with the context; the phase file survives compaction.

**Never tick a box you have not verified.**

**No code review between tasks.** Execute all tasks in the phase first.

After all tasks complete, mark "Phase Nb: Execute tasks" as complete.

#### 3c. Code Review for Phase

Mark "Phase Nc: Code review" as in_progress.

Use the `core:critique-reviewing-code` skill for the review loop.

**Context to provide:**
- WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: Summary of all tasks in this phase
- PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: All tasks from this phase
- BASE_SHA: commit before phase started
- HEAD_SHA: current commit
- PROJECT_GUIDANCE: absolute path to `.loam/project-plan-guidance.md` (**only if it exists**—omit entirely if the file doesn't exist)
- SCRATCHPAD_DIR: session-isolated temp directory for code reviewer scratch files

The implementation guidance file contains project-specific coding standards, testing requirements, and review criteria. When provided, the code reviewer should read it and apply those standards during review.

**Note:** Test requirements validation happens at final review, not per-phase. Per-phase reviews focus on code quality and whether the phase includes tests for its functionality.

**If code reviewer returns a context limit error:**

The phase changed too much for a single review. Chunk the review:

1. Identify the midpoint of tasks in the phase
2. Run code review for first half of tasks (commits for tasks 1 through N/2)
3. Fix any issues found
4. Run code review for second half of tasks (commits for tasks N/2+1 through N)
5. Fix any issues found

**When issues are found:**

1. **Create a task for each issue** (survives compaction):
   ```
   TaskCreate: "Phase N fix [Critical]: <VERBATIM issue description from reviewer>"
   TaskCreate: "Phase N fix [Important]: <VERBATIM issue description from reviewer>"
   TaskCreate: "Phase N fix [Minor]: <VERBATIM issue description from reviewer>"
   ...one task per issue...
   TaskCreate: "Phase N: Re-review after fixes"
   TaskUpdate: set "Re-review" blocked by all fix tasks
   ```

   **Copy issue descriptions VERBATIM**, even if long. After compaction, the task description is all that remains — it must contain the full issue details for executor-review-fixer to understand what to fix.

2. **Dispatch `core:executor-review-fixer`** with the phase file:

```
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">core:executor-review-fixer</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Fixing review issues for Phase X</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
  Fix issues from code review for Phase X.

  Phase file: [absolute path to phase file]

  Code reviewer found these issues:
  [list all issues - Critical, Important, and Minor]

  Read the phase file to understand the tasks and context.

  Your job is to:
  1. Understand root cause of each issue
  2. Apply fixes systematically (Critical → Important → Minor)
  3. Verify with tests/build/lint
  4. Commit your fixes
  5. Report back with evidence

  Work from: [directory]

  Fix every issue, Minor ones included. The goal is zero issues on re-review.
  Minor issues are not optional. Do not skip them.
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

3. **Mark "Fix issues" complete**, then re-review per the `core:critique-reviewing-code` skill.

4. **If re-review finds more issues**, create new fix/re-review tasks. Continue loop until zero issues.

5. **Mark "Re-review" complete** when zero issues.

**Plan execution policy (stricter than general code review):**
- Every issue gets fixed: Critical, Important, and Minor
- Ignore APPROVED/BLOCKED status - count issues only
- **Three-strike rule:** If same issues persist after three review cycles, stop and ask human for help

**Minor issues are NOT optional.** Do not rationalize skipping them with "they're just style issues" or "we can fix those later." The reviewer flagged them for a reason. Fix every single one.

**Exit condition:** Zero issues in all categories — including Minor.

**Then tick the phase's review checkbox.** In the phase file's `## Phase Verification` section, edit `- [ ] Code review passed` to `- [x]`.

Mark "Phase Nc: Code review" as complete.

#### 3d. Move to Next Phase

Proceed to the next phase's "Read" step. Repeat 3a-3c for each phase.

### 4. Update Project Context

After all phases complete, invoke the `meta:project-context-librarian` subagent to review changes and update `AGENTS.md` files if needed.

```
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">meta:project-context-librarian</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Updating project context after implementation</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
  Review what changed during this implementation and update AGENTS.md files if contracts or structure changed.

  Base commit: <commit SHA at start of first phase>
  Current HEAD: <current commit>
  Working directory: <directory>

  Follow the meta:maintaining-project-context skill to:
  1. Diff against base to see what changed
  2. Identify contract/API/structure changes
  3. Update affected AGENTS.md files
  4. Commit documentation updates

  Report back with what was updated (or that no updates were needed).
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**If librarian reports updates:** Review the changes, then proceed to final review.
**If librarian reports no updates needed:** Proceed to final review.

Tick `- [ ] Project context updated` in `final.md`.

### 5. Final Review Sequence

After all phases complete, run a sequence of specialized agents:

```
Code Review → Test Analysis (Coverage + Plan)
```

**`final.md` in the plan directory holds a box for each step below.** Tick each one as you complete it, on the same terms as the phase boxes: only after the step is actually done, never in advance.

#### 5a. Final Code Review

Use the `core:critique-reviewing-code` skill for final code review:

**Context to provide:**
- WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: Summary of all phases completed
- PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Reference to the full project plan directory
- BASE_SHA: commit before first phase started
- HEAD_SHA: current commit
- PROJECT_GUIDANCE: absolute path (if exists)
- SCRATCHPAD_DIR: session-isolated temp directory for code reviewer scratch files
- REQUIREMENTS_COVERAGE_CHECK: "Verify every requirement (using scoped format `{slug}.N.M`) from the design spec is covered by at least one phase, or was explicitly deferred by priority during planning. Flag any unaddressed requirement, and flag any deferred P10."

Continue the review loop until zero issues remain.

Tick `- [ ] Final code review passed` in `final.md`.

#### 5b. Test Analysis

**Only after final code review passes with zero issues.**

**Skip this step if test-requirements.md does not exist.**

The `core:critic-test-analyst` agent performs two sequential tasks with shared analysis:
1. Validate coverage against acceptance criteria
2. Generate human test plan (only if coverage passes)

Dispatch the `core:critic-test-analyst` agent:

```
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">core:critic-test-analyst</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Analyzing test coverage and generating test plan</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
Analyze test implementation against acceptance criteria.

TEST_REQUIREMENTS_PATH: [absolute path to test-requirements.md]
WORKING_DIRECTORY: [project root]
BASE_SHA: [commit before first phase]
HEAD_SHA: [current commit]

Phase 1: Validate that automated tests exist for all acceptance criteria.
Phase 2: If coverage passes, generate human test plan using your analysis.

Return coverage validation result. If PASS, include the human test plan.
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

**If analyst returns coverage FAIL:**

1. Dispatch review-fixer to add missing tests:
   ```
   <invoke name="Task">
   <parameter name="subagent_type">core:executor-review-fixer</parameter>
   <parameter name="description">Adding missing test coverage</parameter>
   <parameter name="prompt">
   Add missing tests identified by the test analyst.

   Missing coverage:
   [list from analyst output]

   For each missing test:
   1. Read the acceptance criterion carefully
   2. Create the test file at the expected location
   3. Write tests that verify the criterion's actual behavior—not just code that passes, but code that would fail if the criterion weren't met
   4. Run tests to confirm they pass
   5. Commit the new tests

   Work from: [directory]
   </parameter>
   </invoke>
   ```

2. Re-run `core:critic-test-analyst`
3. Repeat until coverage PASS or three attempts fail (then escalate to human)

**If analyst returns coverage PASS:**

The response will include the human test plan. Extract the "Human Test Plan" section.

**Write the test plan:**

The test plan lives in the same task folder as the project plan's phase files:

- Task folder: `.loam/tasks/2025-01-24-oauth/`
- Test plan: `.loam/tasks/2025-01-24-oauth/test-plan.md`

Write the test plan content to `.loam/tasks/<slug>/test-plan.md`.

Announce: "Human test plan written to `.loam/tasks/<slug>/test-plan.md`"

Tick `- [ ] Test analysis complete` and `- [ ] Human test plan written` in `final.md`.

### 6. Complete Development

After final review passes:

- Write the **run summary** for the human operator
  - For each phase:
    - How many tasks were implemented
    - How many review cycles were needed
    - Any compromises made (there should be NO compromises, but if any were made). Examples:
      - "I couldn't run the integration tests, so I continued on"
      - "I couldn't generate the client because the dev environment was down"
      - These are partial failures. Explain what the user needs to do now.
    - Were any code-review issues left outstanding at any point?

- Tick `- [ ] Run summary written for the human operator` in `final.md`, last of the five.

- Activate the `core:execute-finishing-a-development-branch` skill — not before this point.

**Under `core:execute-implement-a-project-autonomously`, write the summary in the same turn that ticks that last box.** The run ends the instant nothing is unchecked, so this turn is the last one your human partner will see. A summary deferred to "the next turn" is a summary nobody reads. The finishing skill then asks them a question, which is where autonomy was always going to stop.

## Example Workflow

```
You: I'm using the `core:execute-implement-a-project` skill.

[Discover phases: phase_01.md, phase_02.md, phase_03.md]
[Read first 3 lines of each to get titles]

[Create tasks with TaskCreate:]
- [ ] Phase 1a: Read /path/to/phase_01.md — Project Setup

- [ ] Phase 2b: Execute tasks
- [ ] Phase 2c: Code review
- [ ] Phase 3a: Read /path/to/phase_03.md — API Middleware
- [ ] Phase 3b: Execute tasks

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll read all phases upfront to understand the full picture" | Read one phase at a time. Context limits are real. |
| "I'll skip the read step, I remember what's in the file" | Read just-in-time. Context may have been compacted since. |
| "I'll review after each task to catch issues early" | Review once per phase. Task-level review burns context. |
| "Context error on review, I'll skip the review" | Chunk the review into halves instead. |
| "Minor issues can wait" | Fix them all, Minor included. |
| "I'll tick the checkboxes at the end of the phase" | Tick each as its task is verified. Batched at the end, a crash loses the whole phase. |
| "The task list already tracks this, the checkbox is redundant" | The task list dies with your context. The phase file doesn't. |
| "This task is obviously done, I'll just tick it" | Tick only what you verified. |
